## Hi there! 👋

My name is ***Ben Cresswell*** and I am a post-doctoral research fellow for the Group on Earth Observation's [Global Ecosystems Atlas Project](https://earthobservations.org/solutions/incubators/global-ecosystems-atlas), hosted and led by James Cook University's [Global Ecology Lab](https://www.globalecologylab.org/) 🌏 When I'm not at sea 🌊, mountain-biking 🚲 or thinking about fish ecology 🐠🐟🦈 you can find me here, tinkering on code, analysis and all things data 🤓

If you want to discuss marine ecology or data science I'd love to hear from you - just [drop me a line!](mailto:bjcresswell@gmail.com) 🌴
